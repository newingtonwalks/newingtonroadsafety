<h1>Newington Road Needs a Sidewalk - FAQ Page</h1>	
<details>
	<summary>Would a sidewalk enable residents to safely access schools?</summary>
	<br>
	<p><strong><a id="schools">Yes</a>, there are several schools very close to Newington Road that residents and their kids cannot safely access without a sidewalk including Red Wagon Learning Center, Northern Virginia Academy of Early Learning, and Island Creek Elementary School.
	<p><strong>The lack of a sidewalk creates more traffic congestion in the community and at schools. When parents are forced to drive kids to schools, it causes traffic problems around schools and, <a href="https://www.fcps.edu/family-resources/safety-and-transportation/transportation-services" target="_blank">according to Fairfax County Public Schools</a>, makes it "more difficult for student walkers and bicyclists to get to school."</p></strong> 
	<p>Currently, Newington Road is so dangerous for pedestrians that it is <a href="https://www.fairfaxcounty.gov/planning-development/sites/planning-development/files/assets/documents/compplanamend/newingtonrd/2015-iv-t1.pdf#page=10" target="_blank">"nearly impossible"</a> to reach the local schools without using a car. With a sidewalk, it would be a 16 minute walk.</p></strong>

</details>
<details>
	<summary>Would a sidewalk enable residents to safely access parks?</summary>
	<br>
	<p><strong>Yes, Levelle Dupell Park is a Fairfax County Park located less than 0.25 mile away but instead of a 3 minute walk to the park, residents have to drive a car to get there because there is no sidewalk to get there.</p>

<details>
	<summary>Would a sidewalk enable residents to safely access activity centers and community services?</summary>
	<br>
	<p><strong><a id="centers">Yes</a>, Landsdowne Centre and Hilltop Village are less than a mile away and have more than 45 destinations including day cares, grocery stores, pharamacies, doctor offices, cafes, dentists, restaurants, and more. Residents cannot safely walk to any of these places because there is no sidewalk. Fairfax County's Kingstowne Center for Active Adults and Kingstowne Library also are less than a mile away but residents cannot safely walk to them because there is no sidewalk.</p>

	<summary>Would a sidewalk enable residents to safely access public transit?</summary>
	<br>
	<p><strong><a id="transit">Yes</a>, at the end of Newington Road, there is a Fairfax County Connector bus stop for the <a href="https://www.fairfaxcounty.gov/connector/sites/connector/files/assets/documents/pdf/route%20pdfs/route_334_1022-web.pdf" target="_blank">334 bus</a>.

	<summary>Do sidewalks make roads safer for pedestrians?</summary>
	<br>

</details>
<details>
	<summary>Isn't Newington Road a rural road?</summary>
	<br>
	<p><strong>No, it is lined with single family residential development at <a href="https://www.fairfaxcounty.gov/planning-development/sites/planning-development/files/assets/documents/compplanamend/newingtonrd/2015-iv-t1.pdf#page=4" target="_blank">suburban density levels.</a></p></strong>
</details>
<details>
	<summary>How does a sidewalk align with Fairfax County's goals?</summary>
	<br>
	<strong><p>It directly aligns Fairfax County's Active Transportation Program which is meant to provide "<strong>safe access for pedestrians, especially near <font color="#FF9900">schools</font>, <font color="#669900">parks</font>, <font color="#3300FF">activity centers</font>, and <font color="#00CC99">transit station areas</font>."</strong></p>
	<p>A sidewalk on Newington Road would provide safe access to <font color="#FF9900">schools (Island Creek Elementary, Northern Virginia Academy, Red Wagon Learning Center)</font>, <font color="#669900">parks (Levelle Dupell Park)</font>, <font color="#3300FF">activity centers (Fairfax County Kingstowne Center for Older Adults, Kingstowne Library, Landsdowne Shopping Center)</font>, <font color="#00CC99">transit station areas (334 Fairfax Connector Bus Line, Springfield-Franconia Metro Station)</font>.</p></strong>

	<summary>How would a sidewalk benefit residents?</summary>
	<br>
	<p><strong>Increase safety</strong>: Newington Road is extremely dangerous for pedestrians, seniors, children, dog walkers, joggers, and anyone not traveling in a car. Adding a sidewalk will enable residents to have a safe way to travel in their community, to parks, to schools, to public transit, and to activity centers. Currently, residents cannot safely get to these places without driving a car even though most of them are less than a mile away.</p>
	<p><strong>Reduce traffic</strong>: Residents in the Newington Road community are forced to drive places that are less than a mile away: they have to drive to their local park, drive to the local library, drive to the bus stop down the road, drive to their neighbors house to visit them, drive to activity centers to learn and socialize, drive to schools and daycares, drive to the pharmacy, drive to the grocery store, drive to restaurants. All of this driving contributes to very bad traffic congestion in the area. With a sidewalk, residents could walk to all of these places.</p>
	<p><strong>Decrease emissions and pollution</strong>: If residents did not have to drive their cars to the park, schools, library, grocery store, and more, emissions and pollution would decrease. This is more sustainable and would contribute to better air quality.</p>
	<p><strong>Improve health</strong>: Residents around Newington Road cannot safely walk without a sidewalk and must use a car for nearly every purpose instead of walking. This lack of physical activity has negative consequences for people's health. <a href="https://www.fairfaxcounty.gov/budget/sites/budget/files/assets/documents/fy2023/advertised/cip/14-transportation.pdf?page=15" target="_blank">Fairfax County states</a>: "Physical inactivity is a major contributor to the steady rise in rates
		of obesity, diabetes, heart disease, stroke, and other chronic health conditions in the United States."</p>

<details>
	<summary>Is a planned sidewalk included in Fairfax County's Countywide Trails map?</summary>
	<br>
	<p><strong>Yes it is. The stretch of Newington Road in question is included in the <a href="https://www.fairfaxcounty.gov/planning-development/sites/planning-development/files/assets/documents/maps/trails-plan-map.pdf" target="_blank">Fairfax Countywide Trails Plan Map</a> and should have a "Minor Paved Trail" for pedestrians and bicyclists. The County has not built this.</strong></p>

</details>
<details>
	<summary>Is there any funding for a sidewalk on Newington Road?</summary>
	<br>
	<p><strong>Yes, Fairfax County has <a href="https://www.fairfaxcounty.gov/budget/sites/budget/files/assets/documents/fy2023/advertised/cip/14-transportation.pdf#page=15" target="_blank">approved</a> $100 million for "investments in pedestrian and bicycle infrastructure that will have long-term, meaningful impacts on accessibility, and safety in the community."</p>
	<p>The funding is to provide "safe access for pedestrians, especially near schools, parks, activity centers, and transit station areas." A sidewalk on Newington Road would provide safe access to schools (Island Creek Elementary, Northern Virginia Academy, Red Wagon Learning Center), parks (Levelle Dupell Park), activity centers (Fairfax County Kingstowne Center for Active Adults), transit station areas (334 Fairfax Connector Bus Line, Springfield-Franconia Metro Station).</p></strong>
</details>
<details>
	<summary>Would a sidewalk on Newington Road connect other existing sidewalks together?</summary>
	<br>
	<p><strong><a id="gap">Yes</a>, this 0.4 mile segment of Newington Road that does not have a sidewalk is a "missing link" or "gap" between existing sidewalks on Cinderbed Road and Telegraph Road. Fairfax County has stated that this gap with no sidewalk creates "<a href="https://www.fairfaxcounty.gov/planning-development/sites/planning-development/files/assets/documents/compplanamend/newingtonrd/2015-iv-t1.pdf#page=10" target="_blank">an extremely dangerous situation for bicyclists and pedestrians along this segment."</a>

	<p>"Our mailbox has been hit by cars five times. I never let my kids near Newington Road and drive them to school and the library which are just down the road because there is no sidewalk." - <strong>16 year resident on Newington Road</strong></p>
	<p>"I wish I could let my 15 year old soon walk to the library or grocery store, but he can't because there is no sidewalk. I will not let him walk anywhere near Newington Road." - <strong>8 year resident on Higham Rd off of Newington Road</strong></p></strong>

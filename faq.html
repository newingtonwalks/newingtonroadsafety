<h1>Newington Road Needs a Sidewalk - FAQ Page</h1>		
<details>
	<summary>Would a sidewalk enable residents to safely access schools?</summary>
	<br>
	<p><strong>Yes, there are several schools very close to Newington Road that residents and their kids cannot safely access without a sidewalk including Red Wagon Learning Center, Northern Virginia Academy of Early Learning, and Island Creek Elementary School.</strong>
	<p><strong>The lack of a sidewalk affects everyone.</strong> When parents are forced to drive kids to schools, it causes traffic problems around schools and, <a href="https://www.fcps.edu/family-resources/safety-and-transportation/transportation-services" target="_blank">according to Fairfax County Public Schools</a>, makes it "more difficult for student walkers and bicyclists to get to school." This means that the lack of sidewalk on Newington Road not only affects the residents who live there since they are forced to drive, but the lack of sidewalk also makes traffic worse and more dangerous for others in the community.</p>

<details>
	<summary>Would a sidewalk enable residents to safely access parks?</summary>
	<br>
	<p><strong>Yes, Levelle Dupell Park is a Fairfax County Park located less than 0.25 mile away but instead of a 3 minute walk to the park, residents have to drive a car to get there because there is no sidewalk to get there. Newington Road is so dangerous for pedestrians that Fairfax County has stated it is <a href="https://www.fairfaxcounty.gov/planning-development/sites/planning-development/files/assets/documents/compplanamend/newingtonrd/2015-iv-t1.pdf#page=10" target="_blank">"nearly impossible"</a> for residents in the community to reach Levelle Dupell Park.</p></strong>
</details>
<details>
	<summary>Would a sidewalk enable residents to safely access activity centers?</summary>
	<br>
	<p><strong>Yes, Fairfax County's Kingstowne Center for Older Adults and Kingstowne Library are less than a mile away but residents cannot safely reach them without a car.</strong></p>
	<p><a href="https://www.fairfaxcounty.gov/neighborhood-community-services/kingstowne-center-for-older-adults/location" target="_blank">Kingstowne Center for Older Adults</a> is a Fairfax County community activity center that offers programs and services for older adults in the area. Although it is less than a mile away, older adults on and around Newington Road cannot access this center without driving their car.</p>
	<p><a href="https://www.fairfaxcounty.gov/library/branches/kingstowne" target="_blank">Kingstowne Library</a> is a Fairfax County public library with educational events, kids' programs, and community services. Although it is less than a mile away, residents and their families cannot get to the library without driving their car.</p>
</details>
<details>
	<summary>Would a sidewalk enable residents to access public transit?</summary>
	<br>
	<p><strong>Yes, at the end of Newington Road, there is a Fairfax County Connector bus stop for the <a href="https://www.fairfaxcounty.gov/connector/sites/connector/files/assets/documents/pdf/route%20pdfs/route_334_1022-web.pdf" target="_blank">334 bus</a>. This bus helps residents safely travel without a car and goes to Franconia-Springfield Metro station.</p></strong>
	<p>Unfortunately, Newington Road is so dangerous for pedestrians that Fairfax County has stated it is <a href="https://www.fairfaxcounty.gov/planning-development/sites/planning-development/files/assets/documents/compplanamend/newingtonrd/2015-iv-t1.pdf#page=10" target="_blank">"nearly impossible"</a> for residents in the community to reach this bus stop without using a car. It would be about a 5 minute walk on a sidewalk!</p>

	<summary>Do sidewalks make roads safer for pedestrians?</summary>
	<br>
	<p><strong>Yes, scientists have found that pedestrians are three times more likely to be hit in a crash on a road with no sidewalk.</strong> (<a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0001457521005790" target="_blank">Abou-Senna et al. 2022</a>)</p>

<details>
	<summary>How does a sidewalk align with Fairfax County's goals?</summary>
	<br>
	<strong><p>It directly aligns Fairfax County's Active Transportation Program which is meant to provide "<strong>safe access for pedestrians, especially near schools, parks, activity centers, and transit station areas."</strong></p>
	<p>A sidewalk on Newington Road would provide safe access to <strong>schools</strong> (Island Creek Elementary, Northern Virginia Academy, Red Wagon Learning Center), <strong>parks</strong> (Levelle Dupell Park), <strong>activity centers</strong> (Fairfax County Kingstowne Center for Older Adults, Kingstowne Library), <strong>transit station areas</strong> (334 Fairfax Connector Bus Line, Springfield-Franconia Metro Station).</p></strong>
</details>
<details>
	<summary>How would a sidewalk benefit residents?</summary>
	<br>
	<p><strong>Increase safety</strong>: Newington Road is extremely dangerous for pedestrians, seniors, children, dog walkers, joggers, and anyone not traveling in a car. Adding a sidewalk will enable residents to have a safe way to travel in their community, to parks, to schools, to public transit, and to activity centers. Currently, residents cannot safely get to these places without driving a car even though most of them are less than a mile away.</p>
	<p><strong>Reduce traffic</strong>: Residents in the Newington Road community are forced to drive places that are less than a mile away: they have to drive to their local park, drive to the local library, drive to the bus stop down the road, drive to their neighbors house to visit them, drive to activity centers to learn and socialize, drive to schools and daycares, drive to the pharmacy, drive to the grocery store, drive to restaurants. All of this driving contributes to very bad traffic congestion in the area. With a sidewalk, residents could walk to all of these places.</p>
	<p><strong>Decrease emissions and pollution</strong>: If residents did not have to drive their cars to the park, schools, library, grocery store, and more, emissions and pollution would decrease. This is more sustainable and would contribute to better air quality.</p>
	<p><strong>Improve health</strong>: Residents around Newington Road cannot safely walk without a sidewalk and must use a car for nearly every purpose instead of walking. This lack of physical activity has negative consequences for people's health. <a href="https://www.fairfaxcounty.gov/budget/sites/budget/files/assets/documents/fy2023/advertised/cip/14-transportation.pdf?page=15" target="_blank">Fairfax County states</a>: "Physical inactivity is a major contributor to the steady rise in rates
		of obesity, diabetes, heart disease, stroke, and other chronic health conditions in the United States."</p>

<details>
	<summary>Is a planned sidewalk included in Fairfax County's Countywide Trails map?</summary>
	<br>
	<p><strong>Yes it is. The stretch of Newington Road in question is included in the <a href="https://www.fairfaxcounty.gov/planning-development/sites/planning-development/files/assets/documents/maps/trails-plan-map.pdf" target="_blank">Fairfax Countywide Trails Plan Map</a> and should have a "Minor Paved Trail" for pedestrians and bicyclists. The County has not built this.</strong></p>

</details>
<details>
	<summary>Is there any funding for a sidewalk on Newington Road?</summary>
	<br>
	<p><strong>Yes, there is. Most recently, Fairfax County has approved $100 million for "investments in pedestrian and bicycle infrastructure that will have long-term, meaningful impacts on accessibility, and safety in the community."</p></strong>
	<p>This is part of the County's "Active Transportation Program" which is meant to provide "<strong>safe access for pedestrians, especially near schools, parks, activity centers, and transit station areas"</strong></p>
	<p>A sidewalk on Newington Road would provide safe access to <strong>schools</strong> (Island Creek Elementary, Northern Virginia Academy, Red Wagon Learning Center), <strong>parks</strong> (Levelle Dupell Park), <strong>activity centers</strong> (Fairfax County Kingstowne Center for Older Adults), <strong>transit station areas</strong> (334 Fairfax Connector Bus Line, Springfield-Franconia Metro Station)</p>
</details>
<details>
	<summary>Would a sidewalk on Newington Road connect other existing sidewalks together?</summary>
	<br>
	<p><strong>Yes, this 0.4 mile segment of Newington Road that does not have a sidewalk is a "missing link" between existing sidewalks on Cinderbed Road and Telegraph Road.</strong></p>
</details>
<details>
	<summary>What have neighbors said about why they want a sidewalk?</summary>
	<br>
	<strong><p>"I love to go for walks in parks, but I can't walk past my driveway becasue Newington Road is too dangerous. It's sad but I get in my car and drive somewhere else so I can safely walk." - <strong>30 year resident on Newington Road</strong></p>
	<p>"Our mailbox has been hit by cars five times. I never let my kids near Newington Road and drive them to school and the library which are just down the road because there is no sidewalk." - <strong>16 year resident on Newington Road</strong></p>
	<p>"I wish I could let my 15 year old soon walk to the library or grocery store, but he can't because there is no sidewalk. I will not let him walk anywhere near Newington Road." - <strong>8 year resident on Higham Rd off of Newington Road</strong></p></strong>
